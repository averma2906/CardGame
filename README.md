Game Start and user can choose the number of players. 
After turn will start rotating and user will get their turn and their UI will get enable.
Assumption: 
1. AI is not required as of now. 
2. Auto completion Timer is not required as of now. 
3. Multiplayer is also not required.  All people are playing on same device.
4. Card Comparision : I am assuming that card is compaired based on it's nominal value only.
